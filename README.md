# ðŸ›¸ Projectile Motion Simulation

My implementation of Projectile Motion Simulation using two methods: Euler's and Midpoint. I have used Excel, but one day 
I might implement it in Python once I know the language enough :)

> Added, because I wanted to keep this project in easily findable place - as it has taken quite a while to complete...
